    Parameters
    ----------
    config : nested dict
        Basic configuration for each simulation.
    scenario_table : list of dicts
        Configurations specific for each scenario as a list of dictionaries with
        key/subkey/subsubkey keys.
    seed : int
        Seed for a random generator. All scenarios get the same seed, but each
        simulation within a scenario runs with a different seed based on this one.
    num_simulations : int
        Num of simulations for each scenario.
    num_consignments : int
        Number of shipements in each simulation.

    Returns
    -------
    results : list of tuples
        List of results with one tuple for each scenario. One tuple contains simulation
        result and configuration for that scenario.
